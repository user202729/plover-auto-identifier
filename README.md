You don't have to keep typing `KPA*` or `RUPBD` while programming.

Example usage:

* Type `THRAEUT R*UPBD STROEBG`, `translate_stroke` is printed.
* From the next time, typing `THRAEUT STROEBG` will automatically create `translate_stroke`.

For more details, consult the source code.

There are still a lot of bugs.
